# Hi there, I’m Ein!

I'm a graduate **Mechanical Engineer** from the University of Bristol 🎓
Despite my engineering background, I've become interested and aspire for roles in **data science, MLOps, AI Engineering, and full stack development** - meaning I love to try a little of everything and am actively looking to apply my skills.
Currently, I'm actively looking for any internships and graduate roles in operations and the **quantitative finance sector** in London.
